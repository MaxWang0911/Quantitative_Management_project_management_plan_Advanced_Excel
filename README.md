# Quantitative Project Selection with Advanced Excel

This project showcases advanced Excel-based quantitative methods for capital project selection and risk evaluation under uncertainty. The scenario involves Ewing Natural Gas, which must select projects to maximize Net Present Value (NPV) while staying within annual and total budget constraints over a 3-year horizon.

## 🔧 Tools and Techniques Used

- Excel Solver (Simplex LP and Evolutionary Algorithms)
- Beta-PERT distribution modeling
- Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations)
- Linear Programming for deterministic optimization
- Scenario-based decision making under uncertainty

## 📈 Business Scenario

The company must choose from 12 potential capital projects across three functional areas. Budget caps include:
- Annual cap: $4 billion
- 3-year total cap: $10 billion
- At least one project per functional area must be selected

## 📊 Key Outputs

- Optimal deterministic project portfolio using LP (Max NPV: 1769)
- Risk assessment using Beta-PERT and Monte Carlo simulation
- Probabilistic budget violation analysis (88.7% chance of exceeding total budget)
- Robust solution under uncertainty with 95% confidence constraint (Max NPV: 1635.85)
